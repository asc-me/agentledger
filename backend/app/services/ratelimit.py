"""Rate limiting with a pluggable backend (Phase 5).

One front door — :func:`allow` — used by the login guard, the public feedback
endpoints, and the hosted per-org agent-call cap. Two backends:

- **In-process** (default): the existing sliding-window limiter in ``services.spam``.
  Correct for self-host, a single container, and tests; state is per-process, so caps
  are per-instance.
- **Redis** (``REDIS_URL`` set): a shared fixed-window counter, so a cap holds across
  every replica. Falls open to the in-process check if Redis is unreachable — a rate
  limiter outage must not take the app down.

All current limits are per-minute, matching the in-process window.
