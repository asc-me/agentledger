"""Agent-side project creation, gated on the cloud link (AL-284 / PRD-14 D4).

Project creation is an AUTHORITY gate, and PRD-14's rule is that those stay human. This
is the one deliberate exception, and it is narrow on purpose: an agent may create a
project only where doing so cannot reach anyone else's tenant — a self-hosted box that
is not linked to a cloud org.

Once linked, a locally-created project reaches that org's tenant space and consumes its
quota, so conjuring one becomes a decision belonging to whoever owns the org.

The gate reads `code_sync.link_status()`, which resolves the DB link then the env link.
That is only trustworthy because of AL-281: before it, a CLI-linked instance reported
`linked: false` and this gate would have FAILED OPEN on precisely the instances it
exists for. The parametrised test below covers all three link sources for that reason.
