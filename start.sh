# Graphban — first run (AL-283 / PRD-14 D3).
#
# Brings the stack up and, on an instance with no users yet, provisions an operator,
# a project, and one agent credential — then prints the MCP client config.
#
# Why a script rather than something the agent does: issuing the first credential is an
# AUTHORITY gate ("are you allowed?"), and PRD-14's rule is that those stay human. An
# agent cannot bootstrap itself into existing without that rule collapsing. So the gate
# is satisfied OUT OF BAND — by an operator, on the box they already control — instead
# of being relaxed. Authority never moves; it just stops needing a browser.
#
# Safe to re-run: provisioning keys off "this instance has no users", the same signal
# seed() uses, so a second run changes nothing and re-prints what it can.
